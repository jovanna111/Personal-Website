    <div class="Bio">
      <p class= "glow">  
I am a poet, non-fiction, and imaginative writer. I studied at the university of Warren Wilson college and received a BA in Creative Writing, as well as founded an annual event at the institution called “Poetry and a Melody”. Early on in life I learned that writing is one of the ways I’m able to make sense of and connect with the world at large. In 2016 I participated in a writers retreat at the University of Amherst college with the Juniper Writing Institute. Before this I participated in UrbanWord poetry slams in NY while in high school which was the true catalyst in my writing journey. I’m profoundly inspired by poets and authors like Lucille Cliffton, Octavia Butler, and Langston Hues who’s writing ushers me to commune with my own craft. </p>
